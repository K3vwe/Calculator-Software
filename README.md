# Calculator-Software
The Calculator program is built using HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript. It performs basic mathematical operations.
The Calculator performs mathematical operations by reading a value in and using Regex to seperate the numbers 
from the operators in seperate arrays and operate on those numbers following BODMAS principle.

"The Program is built just to improve my skill using JQuery, JavaScript, CSS and HTML! Nothing Serious Included".
There are more effecient ways the program can be built, i specifically used this way to explore other options.


HAPPY BUILDING AND KEEP ON CODING!
